## How to Play?

You're playing the left paddle and the computer is playing the right one. It's a simple game of Tennis.

You should move the paddle with your mouse. The mouse should always be inside the black canvas for it to work. When the opponent doesn't hit the ball, you get a point and vice-versa. The score will be shown at the top. Whoever reaches 11 points first wins!
